# Pointers-in-C
In this challenge, you will learn to implement the basic functionalities of pointers in C. A pointer in C is a way to share a memory address among different contexts (primarily functions). They are primarily used whenever a function needs to modify the content of a variable that it does not own.  In order to access the memory address of a variable, , prepend it with  sign. For example, &amp;val returns the memory address of .  This memory address is assigned to a pointer and can be shared among various functions. For example,  will assign the memory address of  to pointer . To access the content of the memory to which the pointer points, prepend it with a *. For example, *p will return the value reflected by  and any modification to it will be reflected at the source (). Input Format  The input will contain two integers,  and , separated by a newline.  Output Format  Modify the two values in place and the code stub main() will print their values.  Note: Input/ouput will be automatically handled. You only have to complete the function described in the 'task' section.  Sample Input  4 5 Sample Output  9 1
